            <p class="text-center">
                Many people in Ithaca and on the Cornell campus may want to explore different walking or hiking paths to improve their mental or physical health or explore more of the area. Spending more time active or just spending more time outside can benefit people, so we aim to give people more options and make it easier for them to decide what to do if they take a walk or hike outside. This website is designed to show people the variety of spaces in Ithaca to walk or hike and help them decide where they would like to exercise.

            <p>
                Cornell University, located in Ithaca, New York, is surrounded by a beautiful and picturesque landscape. Within a short distance from our campus, you can be immersed in natural wonders ready to be explored. From lush forests to idyllic bodies of water, Ithaca, New York, is home to incredible natural spaces and scenery. Whether you are an avid nature enjoyer or just looking to get outside and take a short stroll, Ithaca has something for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                The landscape, famous for its stunning gorges and cascading waterfalls, made way for a rich cinematic history, attracting individuals worldwide to come and admire and document the beautiful landscape. Unfortunately, as members of the Cornell community, little effort is made to inform us of the fantastic natural areas right in our own backyard. Considering the ease of access and the abundance of these spaces, it would be a great asset for the members of our community to grow awareness of the beautiful natural spaces we have at our disposal.

            <h3>People</h3>
            <p>
                We intend for the primary users of our document to be members of the Cornell community with a focus on new students. Although some locations covered in our document may be discovered through other outlets, many remain a mystery, even to individuals who have been in Ithaca for extended periods. For this reason, this user document has the potential to provide utility to a larger community, encouraging both outdoor enthusiasts and individuals looking to take a pick break from academic endeavors to get out and explore. 
            </p>
            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>
                Our primary goal is to construct an effective way to easily and efficiently disseminate information that helps the Cornell community engage with their natural environment. We aim to achieve this by building digital materials that serve as tools to create awareness and facilitate exploration. 
            </p>
            <h3>Props</h3>
            <p>
                We are constructing a digital resource that informs users of locations with varying ease of access. It also provides information on how to navigate to each location and a description of each location's offerings. In our design, we felt that a web page could be easily shared and viewed, which aligns with our goal of being accessible within the Cornell community.
